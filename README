My personal java-gradle template

A simple java project giter8 template using gradle as build tool and a little ruby script to make continous testing possible (depends on watchr gem).

To use testing script, use command 'watchr test.watchr' from the project root folder.

To see some avaialable tasks, just use 'gradles tasks' command.
